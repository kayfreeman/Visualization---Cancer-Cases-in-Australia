# Visualization---Cancer-Cases-in-Australia
## Introduction
Cancer poses a significant challenge to public health worldwide, with profound implications for morbidity, mortality, and healthcare expenditure. Feleto et al. (2017) and the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) report in 2021 provide valuable insights into the burden of cancer in Australia. Feleto et al. underscore the prevalence of colorectal cancer and stress the importance of targeted prevention and screening efforts to mitigate its impact. Meanwhile, the AIHW report highlights cancer as a leading cause of illness in Australia and underscores its substantial impact on healthcare expenditure.

Despite Australia's leading position in global cancer survival rates, disparities persist, particularly among individuals residing in rural and remote areas and Indigenous populations (Taylor et al., 2022). These populations experience notably poorer survival outcomes, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions to address disparities in cancer care and outcomes.

Genetic factors play a crucial role in cancer-specific mortality (PCSM), as elucidated by Afshar (2018) and Fitzgerald (2018) in their studies on prostate cancer. Afshar identified genetic variants associated with PCSM, shedding light on the biological pathways modulating tumor aggressiveness. Fitzgerald corroborated these findings, confirming associations between specific genetic variants and PCSM risk. These studies underscore the importance of genetic background in cancer-specific survival and suggest implications for prognostic biomarkers and biological pathways.

To effectively address the complex dynamics of cancer, predictive modeling techniques offer promising avenues for analysis (Feleto et al., 2017). By integrating insights from epidemiological studies, genetic research, and population health reports, researchers can gain a comprehensive understanding of cancer trends. Leveraging machine learning techniques, researchers can develop robust models capable of forecasting cancer occurrence across different demographic groups. This approach holds significant potential for advancing our understanding of cancer epidemiology and guiding targeted prevention and intervention efforts.

This project therefore attempts to visualize using univariate, bivariate and multivariate approaches to displaying information about Cancer cases in Australia using data from a period of 2010 to 2019.
